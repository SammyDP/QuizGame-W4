AS A coding boot camp student,

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores,

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

    GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
    WHEN I click the start button
    THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
    WHEN I answer a question
    THEN I am presented with another question
    WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock
    WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    THEN the game is over
    WHEN the game is over
    THEN I can save my initials and score
